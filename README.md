# Arduino Color Ball Sorter  

## 📌 Project Overview  
The **Arduino Color Ball Sorter** is an automated system that sorts balls based on their color. Currently, it differentiates between **red** and **blue** balls, directing each to the appropriate container. Future updates will introduce support for additional colors.  

Also, this Arduino project is in compliance with our subject, Application Development and Emerging Technologies.

## 🎯 Features  
- Automatically detects and sorts **red** and **blue** balls  
- Uses an Arduino Uno for processing  
- Utilizes servo motors for ball movement  
- Powered by a 9V battery  
- Future updates will expand color detection capabilities  

## 🛠️ Hardware Components  
- **Arduino Uno** (microcontroller)  
- **Color sensor** (e.g., TCS3200)  
- **2 Servo Motors** (to control sorting mechanism)  
- **9V Battery** (for power supply)  

## 🚀 Setup & Installation  
1. **Connect the Components:**  
   - Wire the color sensor to the Arduino for color detection.  
   - Connect the servo motors to control ball movement.  
   - Use a 9V battery to power the system.  
2. **Upload the Code:**  
   - Open the Arduino IDE, load the `color-ball-sorter.ino` file, and upload it to the Arduino Uno.  
3. **Run the System:**  
   - Place the balls into the feeder, and the system will sort **red** and **blue** balls accordingly.
